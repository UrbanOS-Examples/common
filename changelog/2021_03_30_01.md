# Details
Our redis cluster ran out of memory

# Steps Taken
I execed into the redis cli pod in prod and ran the following command:
```bash
redis-cli -h redis.external-services --bigkeys
```

which pointed to the key `discovery-api:view:events:models:9cf13962-5f81-4dbb-bf98-3b9404050744:data:write:complete` as being a list with 4695084 elements in it.  I'm not sure why we keep that many things and I do not believe they are all used so I deleted all except the last 1000 with the following command:

```bash
ltrim discovery-api:view:events:models:9cf13962-5f81-4dbb-bf98-3b9404050744:data:write:complete -1001 -1
```

This freed up about 25% of the memory in the cluster.  We will need to determine how to prevent this moving forward.
