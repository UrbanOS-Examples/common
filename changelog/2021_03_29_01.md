# Details
In an effort to reduce the likelyhood of encountering a rate limit issue when rolling the EKS cluster I pushed copies of two images to ECR.
These images are fluent/fluent-bit and prom/node-exporter.
I chose these images to start with because they are run on every node which causes them to use a bunch of our dockerhub quota.

# Steps Taken
Created the two repos in ECR via: https://github.com/SmartColumbusOS/scos-alm-durable

Locally ran this to pull the images and put them into our ECR
```bash
docker pull fluent/fluent-bit:0.14.4
docker pull prom/node-exporter:v1.0.0

export AWS_PROFILE=<MY_PROFILE>
aws ecr get-login-password --region us-east-2 | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin 199837183662.dkr.ecr.us-east-2.amazonaws.com

#To get the sha
docker image list

docker push 199837183662.dkr.ecr.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/scos/node-exporter:v1.0.0
docker push 199837183662.dkr.ecr.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/scos/fluent-bit:0.14.4
```
